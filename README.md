# GCMServer
Google Cloud Messaging App created during our thesis to integrate CCTV with smoke/motion sensors

Setting up the Windows Application:
You will need the following details to setup your notification sender server. (To be set-up by the developer/technician)
⦁	Port Name – this is the port where your arduino device is connected.
⦁	Baud Rate – a data transmission rate in where data is sent. Will need to be the same rate as the arduino.
⦁	DVR Name – the name of the device in where notifications will be sent.
⦁	IP Address – the IP address of the device in where notifications will be sent.
⦁	Device ID – this is automatically generated by the Android app upon first use and can be found in your email where it was sent.
⦁	After setting up the required information, you can now choose to turn on or off the monitoring of both the Motion Sensor and Smoke Detector. It can also be either of the two.
